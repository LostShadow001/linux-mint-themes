How to install:

(Terminal)
Enter the directory where the folder for the theme is located. Once you 
are there type mv theme-name /home/user-name-here/.themes

(GUI)
Open your prefered file manager click on "Home" and press CTRL+H to 
unhide all of the hidden folders and files.
Once they are unhidden move the folder for the theme that you 
would like to use into the .themes directory and it should work :)

Thank you for downloading!
